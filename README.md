ðŸ‘‹ Hello GitHub community! I'm Gustavo Pasquini, a passionate developer with a keen interest in everything involving technology. I'm thrilled to be part of this vibrant community of developers, designers, and innovators.

ðŸš€ My journey in the world of software development started in 2021 when I had my fist contact with HTML in my school. But now in 2024 I'm focusing more in the programming world, striving to be the best of me.


ðŸ’¬ I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Whether it's contributing to open source projects, exchanging ideas, or tackling new challenges, I'm excited to connect with fellow developers and make meaningful contributions to the community.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me in my email gustavopasquini2006@hotmail.com to discuss anything from coding to coffee! Let's build awesome things together and make a positive impact through technology.
